# Spotify-ETL-Pipeline
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS services to process data from the Spotify API. The pipeline extracts data from Spotify, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into Amazon S3 for further analysis using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.
